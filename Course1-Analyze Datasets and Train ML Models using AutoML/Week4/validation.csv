__label__-1 "ugh i hate that this did n't work ! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is ( the sides go way up on me ) . the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes !"

__label__-1 "i loved this dress and it fit perfectly . i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight and i am really curvy . i did however have a problem trying to take it off . it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back . i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too . i tried to take it off more delicately but i could n't . maybe it was me but this dress is too much hassle . if i went any highe"

__label__1 "i bought the neutral color . this is a lightweight tunic sweater that can be worn during spring . the lace detail is so pretty ... i ordered my normal size small and would have preferred an extra small ... the top flows nice but would 've been a better overall fit if i sized down . i 'm 5 ' 7 140 lbs for reference . make sure you size down at least 1 size ."
__label__-1 "i am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress ! when i received it it looked nothing like it does on the model . the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled . if you have anything above a c cup the top looks completely unflattering . i looked so top heavy in this dress ! definitely not worth the price . so disappointed ."

__label__0 "i really like the idea behind this top but at least for me the execution was n't quite there . i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace ( when it gaps/you move you can see a lot ) . if you do n't move the front panel is pretty opaque which is good . i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i do n't feel comfortable with the sheerness so i returned it . i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked"

__label__1 "this top does run large . i 'm 5 ' 8 142 lbs and usually a medium . i bought a small and probably could have gone xs . that said i love this top . its soft and comfy and swingy . i bought the light red and its pretty true to the online color ."

__label__1 "i stumbled upon the blue version in the store . i immediately liked that it was easy chic and just different-enough . after wearing it for a birthday dinner i saw it online and realized that i had styled it almost exactly the same way the blue one is shown . black sandal wedges silver cuff silver earrings . it is flattering in an unexpected way which may be partially because i am really small-chested . the front v is deep compared to what i usually wear but double-sided tape easily kept my bra"
__label__1 "this dress is so pretty and the petite fits great in the arms and the length is good- just above the knees . the material is nice- not flimsy . i 'm just not sure if it looks right on my petite straight frame . the front is cute but the back is pretty baggy and shapeless . i 've never worn a shirt dress so i 'm not sure if this is how it 's supposed to look ? i tried it with a belt but it does n't seem to work with this dress as there 's a band of loose elastic . probably would look better on a curvier bod"
__label__0 "this dress is a good casual summer dress . the material is thin and feels nice on . the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric does n't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam . the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose . however if you have a larger chest ( i 'm a 34c ) the hook and eye closure dones come undone . overall a good purchase . it looks good with a belt as well ."
__label__-1 "i washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt . i dried it on medium . i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly . i loved the color ( lilac ) . fit and style when i received it and immediately put it on . so sad about the shrinkage . for a $ 58 shirt i expected a bit more . retailer should suggest air drying the shirt . so bummed and disappointed ! ! ! ! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time ."
__label__0 "i purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black . the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything . i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it 's thin and see through . if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it !"
__label__0 "i so wanted to love this top . i first ordered in the medium because previous reviews said it ran large . i got the medium and it ran so small in the arms that i could almost not get it off with ripping it . so i ordered an xl hoping that would work . unfortunately it ran just as small i 'm the arms and i had to return ."
__label__0 "i thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe and while the color did n't disappoint everything else did . it 's a very loose slub so it 's very see through and thin i 'd have to wear a cami under it . also the tie front has a very high slit ! like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt . i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga/ gym wear but definitely not at this price . pass for me sadly ..."

__label__1 "wish i had snagged both styles of this shirt before they sold out . this is a very cute work appropriate top - good weight and quality to the shirt . i wear a lot of black and white at work ( so sick of gray .. why are all business clothes gray ? ) and this top will be added into my regular rotation ."
__label__1 "this dress is great ! the fit is perfect and very flattering . the two colors and asymmetrical hem on the front make it different than you average sundress . looks great with flip flops sandals wedges or booties . will be a great piece for summer but the darker colors also make it the perfect transition to fall dress ."
__label__-1 "i am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes ! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips ... but for those of us with curves ( i 'm a size 12 hourglass ) these are very unflattering . they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds just around the hips ! so bummed because they look so cute on the model ."
__label__-1 "not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos . i have wide shoulders and am slim and this made me look big all around . i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10 and ordered a medium . also it curls under a bit at the waist . one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through . anyway i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning ."
__label__1 "very different . i love the unique design and it is appropriate for various settings ."

__label__-1 "i loved this dress . it runs small ( i 'm normally a 2 ) so i had to get a 4. in the fitting room the zippers got stuck a lot . i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in . finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well . i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding . my fiance and i tried in vain for 20 minutes to try to zip it up ... and then it broke . the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go . it was awful . i co"

__label__0 "i like how this jacket is very versatile . you can wear it to work or play . it does have interesting detail on it i kept it based on the price and those details . i have the olive color . the arms are a little tight ."
__label__0 "i followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down . however the jacket was still too large . it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge . also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy . it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes ."
__label__0 "this dress is beautiful . very vibrant and rich looking ... however after wearing it to work the back of the dress was completely stretched out from sitting in my office chair . when i stood up a little bubble remained around my butt . not attractive . i wanted to love it but it 's going back ."
__label__1 "love this shirt . tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering . the quality of the shirt is great . worth the price for sure !"
__label__0 "i got the black in a medium . it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy . i think it 's the angled wide sides . on me the design just created bulk . nice substantial fabric but it is n't soft or cozy . back it goes"
__label__-1 "i ordered this shirt online and did n't even try it on ... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i do n't want to have that extra layer in the summer . it is cute though !"
__label__1 "i bought this top in 2 colors . it was endlessly comfortable and easy to wear so i bought it in the 3rd color . it 's so versatile that i found myself trying to wear it in too many situations - travel weekends and work . the feel of the fabric is gorgeous but it pills after wear . so when the top went on sale i bought an extra set of all 3 colors . now i have a set for play and a set for work . i love this shirt ."

__label__0 "this dress looks so elegant and perfect for transition from work to night . it looks great on the model but it looked terrible on my . it 's a lovely material but the middle added girth to my stomach area which i did not care for ."
__label__-1 "tried this on at my local retailer the red color is pretty but not a true red . the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days . two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it opening up to the world ! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra this is a deal-breaker for me it ca n't be fixed ."

__label__0 "first of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl . the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways . if you wear it so it 's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa . my only big complaint is that i 've worn it twice and there 's already a large hole in the arm seam . poor construction which is disappointing . hopefully mine was a one-off . i 'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale ."

__label__1 "this cardigan is utterly gorgeous . way prettier on than i feared . my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms and so i finally looked closely at the tag . the tag says the * back * section ( which looks exactly like the weave on the arms ) has a measly 5 % wool snuck into the fabric content . why retailer ? why wool ? i am so sensitive to it ! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it . now i have a problem"

__label__-1 "definitely agree with the other reviewers . this top looks great on the model but pretty bad in real life . super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs . if you plan on ordering i 'd recommend sizing down ."
__label__0 "this may be lovely on some people but it did n't work on me at all . i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight . if i had gone up a size the top would have been huge . the bib was n't flattering on me and it 's also quite sheer . too bad because the print is great . maybe if you 're athletic with slim hips you can manage it . i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you . back it went sadly ."
__label__1 "i do love sheath dresses and this one is very adorable ! true to size and nice length . the black and white is kind of a throwback to the 60s flower power era and really cute . nice weight so feels substantial not the flimsy wrinkly type material ; more like a crepe . very nice !"

__label__1 "i tried this in the black and white in the store . the material is very thin . you can not wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery . the arm holes are cut very inconsistently . some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit . others are cut fine . i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right . this does fit snuggly but is more flattering that way ."
__label__0 "these were a little baggier than expected and the petite size ran long ."

__label__0 "i had really high hopes for this dress and i am still unsure if i 'll keep it or not . i ordered both a small and a medium because i was unsure of this brand . the small fit ( im usually a 4 s/m at retailer - 34b 140 lb 5 ' 8 ) just like it does on the model only the photo online gives the illusion that this is a slight fit-and-flare dress . this is a shift with pleating subtleties on the bustline that bring it in slightly . also the colors should be more like blue multi because there 's a bright a"

__label__0 "i love this dress but it is too short to keep . i am 5 ' 8 and weigh 124lbs . most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer . it looks adorable on but it is just too short ( about 3 inches above my knees ) to be considered professional enough to wear to work ."
__label__1 "this is a perfect outer layer for chilly mornings or nights . the detail on the back and sleeves is definitely retailer quality . the sleeves do run a little long though ."
__label__-1 "i have to agree with the first reviewer ! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i could n't justify it for the price . i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well but just could n't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes ! i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews"
__label__0 "i loved this top when i saw it online and i still love the idea of it . unfortunately the execution of the design fell short . i 'm 5 ' 4 w/ a long lean torso . i ordered my usual small and the arms on the shirt were so long ! b/c of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest i do n't think a petite would work for me . such a cute top but it just wo n't work for me ."
__label__1 "i bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on i promptly went online and ordered two more ! i 've gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them . great for looking put together with no fuss . people that have commented there 's were destroyed in the wash did n't read the care label which says dry clean ."
__label__0 "i purchased the green dress in medium . i usually wear a medium . the fabric is pretty . shoulders fit nicely . sleeves were short in an odd length but that is indeed pictured accurately . the body of the dress is very shapeless billowy and wide which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown . i considered altering the garment by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward but i decided to return the dress ."
__label__0 "i ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer 's comment that they were unflattering on the back side . they really do hug your bum but that is not what bothers me . what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top they are not wearable in public or around other people . i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer but also some of the most poorly designed . unfortunately these fall in the latter category ."
__label__-1 "this top runs super small in the upper arms shoulder area .. could not even stretch out my arms ! ... other then that major problem the length and body fit were perfect ... i am true med and/or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes 10 12 and neither worked for me due to arm/shoulder fit ... disappointed because it really is a beautiful top ..."

__label__0 "i love the front of this shirt but i really should have paid more attention to the details of it . i would have realized the front and back are different materials which i am not a fan of . i would have preferred the entire thing was made of the dressier front material instead of the jersey back . it 's like a mullet business in the front and party in the back . it 's got great drape and is a beautiful blue though so into rotation it goes ."
__label__1 "comfortable shorts . thinner fabric . pattern disguises underwear lines . love the exterior pockets as i wo n't have to tuck them in when i zip up . as the previous reviewer said the black and white pattern has blue accents . they 're mid-rise and a longer length which i appreciate ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this coat so bad . the material is lovely and it 's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off . if you have any hips forget it ( my hips are 38 ) - you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy . the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders .... like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted it was weird . but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it was n't a size thing . i bought a size medium at 5 ' 5 and 140 pounds ."
__label__1 "i ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination . i love everything about this dress . it 's comfortable . the colors are cheerful . the proportions of where the stripes are placed works . but i have to return this dress . it 's too short for what i 'm comfortable wearing . i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models . i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me . unfortunately it 's just too short and i 'd feel self-conscious . i do n't want to deal"
__label__1 "great sweater . cozy and thick . the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place . the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater . i got a small and it fit perfectly ."

__label__1 "very cute plaid button down that is tts ; i am busty and the l fit just right with enough room without the buttons doing the splits like most shirts . the dainty details & material of this button down makes this stand out from other button downs that look like flannels -- which this is not . it is woven of a fine material enough to be able to wear a camisole underneath it is not a flannel shirt . colors are vibrant and the purple in the back really is quite attractive . happy i got this on sale & sale"
__label__-1 "i ordered this dress in my usual sz 2 it seemed to be tight on the hips then i tried the next sz 4 and it was tight because i realized that the lining was very sticky and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me not for curvy on bottom . i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason . i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute and i really liked the look of the dress if it goes on sale i may purch"

__label__0 "i like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it . however i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable . there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating . also would not recommend if you are busty . because of how the stripes run it looks stretched out over my chest ."

__label__0 "this is just okay for me . the top is soft and surprisingly flattering especially from the side but the front rides up and the neckline never lays flat . it washes well and the tan/white combo is cute but a little transparent ."
__label__-1 "after reading the reviews i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it was n't flattering on me . i 'm 5 ' 4 126 pounds and generally wear a size small but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me . it squeezed the bust a bit too much and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering ."

__label__-1 "i ordered a small and it is enormous ; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler . also it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s . i 'm sending it back ."
__label__-1 "these are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom ! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight but these fit perfectly ( even on the looser side ) and ripped effortlessly . pretty embarrassing given the price ! bringing these back ! for reference ( if you decide to try your luck ) i am 5 ' 7 128 # and my normal size s was perfect ."

__label__-1 "i ordered this top in a 14 my usual size and it fits fine but it is way too short-waisted ! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing . her top comes low on her waist almost to her crotch area . mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button ! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory ! very strange ."
__label__0 "i am on the fence about this one . the length is great . it hits right above my knee at 5 ' 1 . overall it was larger than i was hoping . the waist is pretty loose and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit . the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide . i wish they had it in a petite size . for this price i will probably return it . it 's not worth the 300 price tag ."

__label__-1 "the skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip . even though it has a built in slip it is still see through . the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt . if it was n't see through i would keep it ."
__label__0 "i love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off . it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear . i do n't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work . it is a shame because i really liked the look of it ."
__label__-1 "i fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online the slip underneath is a nude color . it fit well and i decided to keep it . i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it . i was driving with my son in the back seat i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress ( where the crocheting is ) ripped open ! ! i can not believe how poor the quality is at this price !"

__label__1 "this top is a very comfortable very easy top to wear . it is perfect for laying with work clothes or styling a bit more casually for just wearing out and about . i ordered it in the light blue color and it is beautiful- very soft and feminine . the ruffle lays really well down the front which i was concerned about because of how busty i am . i ordered a small and it fits just right . i think the knit back really helps with that . very nice !"

__label__0 "i 'm very pale and on me the rose color looked really washed out . the catalog photo is not an accurate representation . look at the product shot for a truer representation . it 's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin . i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin though ."
__label__1 "just bought this at the store . just to be safe i thought i would try it on before ordering just to confirm the size . that was a good idea . ( i am a 38b 5 ' 9 and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts . ) the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest . when directly compared to the medium it seems the major difference is the length -- the large was > 1 longer than the medium . i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok ."

__label__-1 "i was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern . however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness . the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top . i wanted to keep this but h"

__label__-1 "the fabric of this top is lovely . the fit not so . it does not fit as shown on the model . the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a swing top . i am 5 ' 9 slim build . i ordered my usual size medium . shoulders and back fit perfectly . too much material around the middle . had it had a straight cut to it as shown i 'd keep it . because it does n't it 's going back ."

__label__-1 "this runs sooo big ! i normally wear a large ( 145lb 5'-4 36dd ) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large . the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together ! i loved the pattern color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent lol . also the back is slightly longer than the front something i couldnt see from the pictures online ."

__label__-1 "given that i am petite with thighs ( take a size 6p or 28p ) these were not for me ! the run small are really tight from the thigh up run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin . on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient . i was looking for something i could wear to work and these were not the right style for that . plus they seemed cheaply made like they would n't stand the test of time . i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model they would look good"

__label__-1 "this skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away . i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on but was disappointed by the awkward ruching . if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband ( thereby also shortening it to knee length ) it would have been lovely . it should be noted that this is midi-length which is awkward on me . i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely ."
__label__1 "this dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile . great for dressing up or down . i am large busted ( 36g ) so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover . i am petite 51 with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great !"
__label__1 "beautiful feminine flowy dress . love the brass button detail at neckline and around waist-gives the otherwise delicate dress a pop of edge . had to detach the slip to get it on but glad it is included with the dress . i purchased the small and fits like a glove ( 5 ' 8 135lbs 34d ) . ca n't wait to wear it ! !"
__label__1 "these are super soft and relaxed . i have them in navy and lavender . i am 5 ' 6 and 130 lbs . and ordered them in a 28 which fits loosely but comfortably ."
__label__1 "i love this skirt . it fits perfectly . great to transition from work to after-work event . very comfy . got lots of complements ."
__label__-1 "the dresss is much shorter than described . very see thru though guess you can tell from picture . expected more for the price ."
__label__0 "i feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee . it 's a lovely pattern and i like the fit ( it 's not clingy ) but it 's a bit see-though . it 's not as bad as the other tee but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt ( unless that 's your thing ) . that said i 'm happy with it because it 's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather . i am very glad i got it on sale though . i would n't have paid full price for it ."
__label__-1 "this is so close to perfect but there 's a seam down the middle of the back and they did n't bother to match the polka dots . you can see the mismatch in the second photo . i was about to buy the jacket and totally in love when i turned and saw the error . i hoped it was one bad match but nope on every one . could n't unsee did n't buy . very disappointed ."
__label__-1 "i have been looking for an off-white vest and thought this one would be perfect except it is going back . i am 5 ' 9 150 lbs . medium is my normal top size but this medium was tight even though the design looks relaxed in the picture . no buttons so no way to close it . unlined and the design and fabric look more casual than the photo . not worth the price ."
__label__-1 "this a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure . this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure - small waist feminine hips ."
__label__0 "so this is still a pretty cute shirt but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt . it does n't seem to be defective just a different version of the shirt . i 'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have . still deciding whether to keep or not . no more left in xs to place another order and see what 's up . i do wish it had the ruffle in front as that is what caught my eye ."
__label__1 "the patters/colors on this dress are much more stunning in person . it is lined and feels very well made . the pockets do n't add bulk to the hip area as many times they do which is great . the fit can be tricky if you have any semblance of curves . if you can try this one on in a store before buying . for reference : i am 5 ' 7 have broad shoulders am pear shaped ( i have hips and a good sized rear end ) 34b bust weigh 145 lbs . and generally wear a size 6 or 8 for tops and bottoms . the size 8 fit"
__label__-1 "i loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on : a good cut -- not too drapey or fitted . but then i washed it ( laid flat to dry ) and it shrunk so much that it 's unwearable now . so disappointing ."
__label__0 "love the fabric and it seemed warmed . but as other reviewers mentioned the neckline was awkward ."
__label__1 "snap this one up but make sure you order a size larger than your normal size . it runs a full size too small . it sold out before and i was told it was n't coming back in . i had purchased one previously in my regular size but it was too small . to my delight it 's back and i 've purchased one in the next size up . it 's well made can go from business to sport to casual ."
__label__-1 "i too will be returning this sweater . love the style shape and fabric but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap ."

__label__-1 "i ordered these in m ( 5 ' 8 140 lbs . ) and they are tts : they fit well and are neither tight nor loose . the issue that i have with them ( and the reason that i sent them back ) is that the material although comfortable is completely transparent ; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless ! furthermore these are not white but off-white ( and quite a yellowy off-white at that ) so these loungers do n't look as cute with the feature"

__label__-1 "i had high hopes for this top based on the photos but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top . the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it almost like a tie dye or slub effect . not pretty at all ."
__label__1 "i knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable beautiful fabric cute gold buttons ! as well due to the cut it feels roomy but has a slender fit around the arms . the denim color has beautiful detail but i do n't think i would like the maroon solid . i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one !"
__label__0 "i ordered this top because i liked the look in the back however the top i received looks nothing like the back . online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered . also online it shows thin straps ( that look like a bra strap ) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd ! ! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to did n't have any information or complaints about the top . i 'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front but i was really wanting the back to lo"

__label__-1 "too thin at bottom where lace is . could n't sit in the dress without worrying i was hanging out"
__label__0 "i tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note . it 's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store . also it 's unlined . i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined . given its hem i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too ."
__label__0 "nice lines just a bit tight if you have larger / more muscley shoulders ."
__label__-1 "did not work for me . whatsoever . the stripes were adorable but the piece just did n't fit like on the model . the collar was practically choking me and the tie just did n't make my figure look the way it normally does . aka i looked frumpy and chunky which i 'm not . going back ."
__label__0 "i loved the color of these but they bagged out with just one wear . they are going back to store ."
__label__1 "these are called jeans but they are n't exactly jean material . they are black with a nice stretch to the fabric . a bit tighter on the thighs than the flare jeans but the stretch to the fabric makes it work . i like these very much a very slimming effect . mid rise- which looks very chic.highly recommend !"
__label__1 "size down ! i love this item . it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth . hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some ."

__label__0 "i loved the look of this tunic . it is made well and very pretty . it was so big and heavy i had to return it . i think the small in this would be too big ."
__label__0 "this is the perfect peplum . it floats a bit but does n't stick out and is super flattering . that 's why i kept mine even though the front seams were like an inch off and the peplum pleat is crooked . geeze retailer . this is why i ca n't justify buying much of anything unless it 's on sale . quality in recent years has gone wayyyy downhill ."
__label__1 "women who want some flutter without too much fullness"
__label__-1 "very disappointed . ordered two sizes the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i would n't have worn it and the zipper was sticking . the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked . some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $ 100 but at $ 228 they are not . returning both sizes ."
__label__-1 "love the fit of the jeans just wish there was a couple more inches at the bottom : ) these jeans have a 23 inch inseam not 26 so they hit at a very odd place on my calf- return . for reference i 'm 5 ' 8"
__label__-1 "the fit of this top is nothing like in the photo . the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette . in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large . the embroidery details and soft material are great but the fit is off entirely . this item is going back ."
__label__1 "i saw this online and thought hmm no . then saw it in the store touched it and the fabric felt so soft . i am normally an 8 petite in cartonnier but the only sizes available were 4 and 2 regulars in-store . the 4 just looked promising . i thought i 'd try it on for laughs . but it is soooo cute i ended up taking it home . the 4 regular fits perfectly on my curvy on the bottom 5 ' 2 145 lb figure . my measurements are 34 ( b ) -29-38 and i was shocked how well this fits in a 4 regular ! perfect length a"
__label__-1 "i tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 ( a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea ) . the 4 fit in the outer layer however as the previous poster mentioned the lining is super tight . i could n't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips . the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining . not sure what when wrong here but it 's a shame because it 's a really cute dress ."
__label__0 "i love the style of this top and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts . it 's somewhat fitted on the top yet it 's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom . the ruffled v-neckline is pretty and i like the longer length of the short sleeves . but with all these attributes unfortunately they cut the armholes really big so when you put your arms forward the sleeves pull against your arms . i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway but for $ 98 dollars i thin"
__label__0 "i read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it . first the good : i love the color the fabric and the design . it 's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days . the neck and sleeves are pretty on . i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things . now the bad : it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package ! im surprised a"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to like these but they just did n't look right on my 5 ' 3 sorta bulky frame . i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings so maybe i 'm just not the right target for these but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try . the waist was too high for my liking and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look ."
__label__1 "it 's a cozy sweater that does n't make me feel frumpy still stylish and it 's not too heavy but still warm enough . it 's like wearing a blanket sort of . definitely sheer with the big loom wear a camisole under it . i got compliments the first day i wore it !"
__label__-1 "i really liked the style and fit of this shirt but i 'm giving it a 2 because i shirt should last longer than 6 months . i 've taken it to the cleaners 2 times and the fabric behind the tag beneath the collar has fallen apart and there are holes ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this sweater but the fit is off slightly . i ordered my regular size xs and the chest/shoulder area fits nice but the waist comes very tight and not flattering to wear unless style similar to the model with a tucked in look . nice color and decent quality fabric but not my favorite fit . going back to the store ."
__label__-1 "just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper . it 's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer 's picture does n't match the actual product . it does fit true to size however ."
__label__0 "this is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight . however it is an awkward length . i am tall and have a long torso so it 's just not cut right for me and was not flattering ."
__label__-1 "unique jacket ..... but when i put it on i felt and looked like charlie brown . this will be going back ."
__label__0 "i ordered this in the pink color . the fit was fine but i did n't care for how thin it was . there is lining which i suppose is there to combat the thinness but it 's only in certain places . the lining should have been all over . maybe if i had gotten this in blue it would n't have been so bad ."
__label__0 "i agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big . for my body straight up and down i ordered 2 sizes down but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store . the jeans i received were lighter not blue and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering . i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair but for me because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture ."
__label__-1 "as the other reviewer said the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous . i do n't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip . i 'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well . very very strangely constructed-i could n't keep it even at the deeply discounted price"
__label__0 "this top is so pretty in the photos but it just did not work out for me . it is more of a pale pink color than off-white like in the photo and it just hung on me weird . i felt like it was true to size but made me feel very boxy . i can say it was very well made so maybe i 'm just not the right body type for it . for reference i 'm 5 ' 5 and 135lbs . the small fit perfectly but was a bit too wide at the bottom for my taste . i was willing to spend the money if it would have been perfect but i 'll sa"
__label__1 "i have absolutely nothing negative to say about this shirt . it 's comfortable the fit is excellent and flattering and it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion . i bought it in the brown and the black and have no regrets ."
__label__-1 "this is huge . i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape . there is no shape to this and is a lot of material . i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses sometimes medium in sweaters . it seamed like 2 sizes too big . the material is very soft and the collar is nice . there is a ribbon tie at the waist . the tie is wimpy and could be nicer . when tied there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist ."
__label__-1 "like most people here i wanted this beautiful dress to fit . so i decided to see for myself if maybe just maybe the negative reviews were wrong . they were n't . if you have any sort of breasts at all the top probably wo n't fit properly . i imagine a narrow upper torso like a 32 or 33 possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly but with a 36 c i could not get a size 12 to button up . the waist hit at a strange spot and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad"
__label__-1 "these jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they 'd been washed twice . put them on and - rip ! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear . poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer . : - ( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit ."
__label__0 "this top reminded me of a maternity top . cute but better suited for someone smaller chested ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person . the fabric is a rough gauzy texture . the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something they do not hang or move well on the body . also they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off . sadly these are going back ."
__label__1 "this tank is very loose fitting which i can understand would make some think it runs large . taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted . i love the draped styling which i also think makes sense with the pattern . it 's an easy top too ... just throw on and go . and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this because it 's all my favorites : simple chic design ; pure silk ; gorgeous color . in reality the dress was 100 % see-through very thin and poor quality silk . i posted pictures of me wearing this dress with a nude slip on underneath that i brought along for shopping elsewhere for business dresses . despite the thin quality of the silk i was still considering spending this dress ( despite it 's unreasonably high $ $ $ for the quality ) but after trying it on i was really disappoin"
__label__0 "this is a cute top but the fit is problematic . it runs small on top especially around the bust and sleeves but then it flares below the waist in a billowy and unflattering way with way too much fabric . i got both an xsp and an xxsp . the xxsp fit better on bottom but i could hardly pull my arms through the sleeves . both are going back unfortunately . for reference i 'm 5 ' 103 lbs 32b ."
__label__1 "i hope you can get this top.this is a great classic that will be in my closet for a long time ."
__label__-1 "i loved this tunic the first time i wore it . i ordered it in the red and it was very flattering on my post-pregnancy figure and extremely cute with leggings and boots - just what i wanted . it fit true to size even with a few extra pounds around the chest area . imagine my horror when i pulled it out of the wash - having followed the directions on the tag exactly - and discovered it had shrunk and no longer fit properly . in particular the sleeves became incredibly uncomfortably tight and much sh"
